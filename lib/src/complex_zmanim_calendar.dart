/// <p>This class extends ZmanimCalendar and provides many more zmanim than available in the ZmanimCalendar. The basis for
/// most zmanim in this class are from the _sefer_ <b><a href="http://hebrewbooks.org/9765">Yisroel Vehazmanim</a></b>
/// by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisroel_Dovid_Harfenes">Rabbi Yisrael Dovid Harfenes</a></b>.
/// As an example of the number of different <em>zmanim</em> made available by this class, there are methods to return 18
/// different calculations for <em>alos</em> (dawn), 18 for <em>plag hamincha</em> and 29 for <em>tzais</em> available in this
/// API. The real power of this API is the ease in calculating <em>zmanim</em> that are not part of the library. The methods for
/// <em>zmanim</em> calculations not present in this class or it's superclass  {@link ZmanimCalendar} are contained in the
/// [AstronomicalCalendar], the base class of the calendars in our API since they are generic methods for calculating
/// time based on degrees or time before or after [getSunrise sunrise and [getSunset sunset and are of interest
/// for calculation beyond _zmanim_ calculations. Here are some examples.
/// <p>First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate:
///
/// <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
/// String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;
/// double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ
/// double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ
/// double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters
/// // the String parameter in getTimeZone] has to be a valid timezone listed in
/// // {link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs]
/// TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);
/// GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);
/// ComplexZmanimCalendar czc = new ComplexZmanimCalendar(location);
/// // Optionally set the date or it will default to today's date
/// czc.getCalendar].set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);
/// czc.getCalendar].set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);</pre>
/// <p>
/// <b>Note:</b> For locations such as Israel where the beginning and end of daylight savings time can fluctuate from
/// year to year, if your version of Java does not have an <a href=
/// "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tzdata-versions-138805.html">up to date timezone database</a>, create a
/// {link java.util.SimpleTimeZone with the known start and end of DST.
/// To get _alos_ calculated as 14° below the horizon (as calculated in the calendars published in Montreal),
/// add {link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH (90) to the 14° offset to get the desired time:
/// <br><br>
/// <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
///  Date alos14 = czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH + 14);</pre>
/// <p>
/// To get _mincha gedola_ calculated based on the _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Gombinern"
/// >Magen Avraham (MGA)</a>_ using a _shaah zmanis_ based on the day starting
/// 16.1° below the horizon (and ending 16.1° after sunset) the following calculation can be used:
///
/// <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
/// Date minchaGedola = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees], czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees] * 6.5);</pre>
/// <p>
/// or even simpler using the included convenience methods
/// <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
/// Date minchaGedola = czc.getMinchaGedola(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees], czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees]);</pre>
/// <p>
/// A little more complex example would be calculating zmanim that rely on a _shaah zmanis_ that is
/// not present in this library. While a drop more complex, it is still rather easy. An example would be to calculate
/// the _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Isserlein">Trumas Hadeshen</a>'s_ _alos_ to
/// _tzais_ based _plag hamincha_ as calculated in the Machzikei Hadass calendar in Manchester, England.
/// A number of this calendar's zmanim are calculated based on a day starting at _alos_ of 12° before sunrise
/// and ending at _tzais_ of 7.083° after sunset. Be aware that since the _alos_ and _tzais_
/// do not use identical degree based offsets, this leads to _chatzos_ being at a time other than the
/// [getSunTransit] solar transit (solar midday). To calculate this zman, use the following steps. Note that
/// _plag hamincha_ is 10.75 hours after the start of the day, and the following steps are all that it takes.
/// <br>
/// <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">

/// Something a drop more challenging, but still simple, would be calculating a zman using the same "complex" offset day
/// used in the above mentioned Manchester calendar, but for a _shaos zmaniyos_ based _zman_ not not
